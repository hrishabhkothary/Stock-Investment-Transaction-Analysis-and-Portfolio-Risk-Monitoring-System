# Industrial-Grade Electronic Stock Investment Transaction & Portfolio Management System:

‚úÖ What it basically does
This project simulates a complete electronic stock investment system for financial institutions and retail brokers.

**It does three main things:**
1Ô∏è. Simulates real-time stock transactions:
It generates large, realistic trade data ‚Äî thousands of buys and sells ‚Äî for multiple investors and stocks.

2Ô∏è. Performs ETL and data warehousing:
It ingests these transactions, stores them in a relational database (MySQL), and runs advanced SQL logic (joins, subqueries) to aggregate data into investor portfolios.

3Ô∏è. Provides insights and monitoring:
It calculates each investor‚Äôs total holdings, average buy prices, and assigns basic risk scores. It visualizes this data to help detect unusual trading activity or concentrated risk.
