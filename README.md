# üìà Stock Investment Transaction Analysis and Portfolio Risk Monitoring System

# Industrial-Grade Electronic Stock Investment Transaction & Portfolio Management System:

‚úÖ What it basically does
This project simulates a complete electronic stock investment system for financial institutions and retail brokers.

**It does three main things:**
1Ô∏è. Simulates real-time stock transactions:
It generates large, realistic trade data ‚Äî thousands of buys and sells ‚Äî for multiple investors and stocks.

2Ô∏è. Performs ETL and data warehousing:
It ingests these transactions, stores them in a relational database (MySQL), and runs advanced SQL logic (joins, subqueries) to aggregate data into investor portfolios.

3Ô∏è. Provides insights and monitoring:
It calculates each investor‚Äôs total holdings, average buy prices, and assigns basic risk scores. It visualizes this data to help detect unusual trading activity or concentrated risk.

**How it may help institutions:**

1. Retail brokerages & fintech startups:
Can use similar pipelines to process daily buy/sell orders, calculate customer holdings, and keep portfolios up-to-date.

2. Investment banks:
Can adapt the logic to detect high-risk or unusual trades, helping compliance and risk management teams flag suspicious activity.

3. Data analysts & quants:
Can extend this pipeline for deeper portfolio performance analysis, profit/loss reporting, or trade pattern detection.

4. Automation benefit:
The system runs in batch mode (hourly or daily) or can be extended for real-time, just like production-grade trading systems.
