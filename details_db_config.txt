📌 What db_config.py does:

db_config.py is NOT meant to run independently.
It defines one thing:



def get_engine():
    # connection settings
    return engine

This means:

-It only provides a reusable database connection.

-It does NOT do any work by itself when run directly.

-It’s imported by other Python scripts:

-seed_investors.py → from db_config import get_engine

-load_transactions.py → from db_config import get_engine

-update_portfolio.py → same

-analyze.py → same

✅ So every script that needs the database connection calls get_engine().

⚡ What happens if you run db_config.py alone?
If you run:

python db_config.py

👉 Nothing will happen (unless you added a print at the bottom).

It just defines a function — no side effects.

✅ Where it’s embedded:

| File                   | How `db_config.py` is used                |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `seed_investors.py`    | Uses `get_engine()` to insert investors   |
| `load_transactions.py` | Uses `get_engine()` to push CSV data      |
| `update_portfolio.py`  | Uses `get_engine()` to update risk table  |
| `analyze.py`           | Uses `get_engine()` to run SELECT queries |


✅ Why it’s good practice:

Using a single db_config.py:

-Keeps credentials in one place.

-Makes sure you don’t duplicate connection code.

-Easy to update password/host in one file.

📌 Conclusion:

✔️ You should NOT run db_config.py directly.

✔️ Other files automatically call it to get a live connection.

✔️ If db_config.py has a wrong password or host, ALL scripts will fail — so keep it correct!

✅ Check if it works
Do this quick test:


# Add at bottom of db_config.py

if __name__ == "__main__":
    engine = get_engine()
    print(engine)

Then:


python db_config.py

👉 If it prints <sqlalchemy.engine>, your connection string is valid.

If it errors → fix your host/user/pass.

🔑 In short:

db_config.py is NOT a main script, but the core connector your project needs.
Keep it clean — and your pipeline stays robust!
